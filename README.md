# CV-JD-Harmony
A microservices-based web application designed to intelligently analyze and evaluate resumes against job descriptions using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system mimics an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) by parsing uploaded resumes and job postings, extracting key entities like skills, experience, and qualifications, and generating a compatibility score.

Built with scalable technologies like Go, Python, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, and Amazon S3, it allows recruiters and job seekers to:

Upload resumes and job descriptions in PDF format

Automatically extract and clean structured data

Match resumes to job descriptions using keyword and context-based scoring

View detailed analytics and feedback to optimize candidate-job fit

With real-time communication between services using gRPC, efficient background processing with RabbitMQ, and performance optimizations like Redis caching, this application is optimized for scalability, speed, and accuracy.
